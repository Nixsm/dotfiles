;; Version: 0.1
;; Package-Version: 20150727.31
;; URL: https://github.com/abingham/emacs-ycmd
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24") (dash "1.2.0") (flycheck "0.22") (ycmd "0.9"))

;;
;; Description:
;;
;; This provides flycheck integration for ycmd. It allows flycheck to
;; use ycmd's parse results for it display. It essentially works by
;; caching the ycmd parse results and then using them when the checker
;; is invoked.
;;
;; Basic usage:
;;
;;  (require 'flycheck-ycmd)
;;  (flycheck-ycmd-setup)
