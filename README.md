I currently have one main dotfile repository (private), since it's getting too big
I decided to separete OSX and Linux's dotfiles. This repository is specific for Archlinux.
The reason I am doing this is because I started having Linux specific files on my OSX and OSX specific files on
my Linux box, and that kinda sucked.

My OSX dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/ephexeve/OSX-bootstrap)

Run ```bootstrap/install.sh``` to start the bootstrap
